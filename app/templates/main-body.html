            <p><span class="dropCap">L</span>o<p>Everyone in the packed Bucks County church had come to say goodbye to the 45-year-old man in the casket by the altar. "Jimmy" to some; "Jim" if he had once saved your life; "Jamie" if you were his sister, mom, or one of the grade school gang who built tree forts and played street hockey back in the St. Cecilia days in Northeast Philadelphia.</p>
<p>If you had consulted only his spare obituary, you would have encountered the deceased as James T. Cunningham, "beloved" son, "loving" father. A man who had "helped many people during his professional career." But to some of his oldest friends inside St. Joseph's Catholic Church that day in February, there was so much more to the story.</p>
<p>Cunningham, a former Fox Chase altar boy, had taken his life in the middle of the night after a months-long slide into despair. The end came inside a Doylestown apartment, surrounded by police and some of the Bucks County SWAT team members he had once coached in situations just like those. A professional counselor, Cunningham used to be the guy who helped cops save the most desperate of men.</p>
<p>As several priests set to begin Funeral Mass, friends in the back of the church quietly fumed. Like Jimmy, they were St. Cecilia grade school Class of 1985, a group of kids whose priest, Father James J. Brzyski, was so vile that prosecutors would identify him years later as one of the most brutal sexual abusers to serve in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The church learned of Brzyski's pedophilia in 1984 but told no one in the community. His legacy of destruction continued for decades, all the way to this February 2017 funeral in Warrington.</p>
<p>"No," said Kevin Emery. "I can't do it." He and a half dozen others wanted to leave before Mass.</p>
<p>He and others had learned about the priest's predations in 2005 through a Philadelphia grand jury report that sent no one to jail. But as far as anyone knew, Jimmy -- a scrawny little bookworm buddy of theirs -- had been among the lucky ones to avoid the predator's reach. Jimmy earned a Master's, became a dad, had a tough divorce. He built a respected career as a prison counseling supervisor and made history by winning a Democratic supervisor slot in the Republican heart of Bucks County during the presidency of George W. Bush.</p>
<p>But in July 2016, as Philadelphia's Catholic archbishop publicly fought efforts to extend legal rights for sexually abused children in Pennsylvania, Cunningham made a startling admission on Facebook. His life then came undone.</p>
<p>"This is the face," Cunningham posted before hanging himself earlier this year, "of an adult raped as a child."</p>
<p>Emery saved a photograph of that post on the phone in his pocket. He stiffened in the pew as priests hovered near the casket.  The St. Cecilia's kids already had absorbed the shock of the national Catholic clergy abuse scandal in 2002. Others were blindsided by Brzyski's unmasking in 2005. Some had just buried, in 2016, altar boy Jimmy Spoerl, who'd publicly accused Brzyski of abusing him. Now Jimmy Cunningham's funeral -- and while six of Pennsylvania's eight Catholic dioceses were under criminal investigation by the state attorney general.</p>
<p>"We gotta leave," Emery recalled a few in the group saying. "We can't stay here for this. This is wrong. It's a disrespect to him."</p>
<p>The Inquirer pieced together this story through interviews over six months with friends, family, associates and former classmates of Jim Cunningham. He was among the walking wounded of a single grade school class, a generation for whom, even now as adults, the horror associated with a single parish priest has seemed to have no end.</p>
<p>Cunningham spent his life saving others from themselves. But his own words on Facebook revealed he could not save himself. He was damaged, he wrote, because of Brzyski.  A former cleric he had not seen in decades, but who the Inquirer would find living in Texas. A man with dogs, a meticulous garden, and an enduring freedom unchallenged by prosecutors because the church told no one of his abuse for years.</p>
<p>"There was no way I was going to stay at a Mass for my friend who had been raped and subsequently hung himself because of it," Emery said, so he and a few others left the church. "I wasn't going to sit there for that Mass and try to make like it's okay."</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>CHILDHOOD IN FOX CHASE:</p>
<p>You never forget the neighborhood. Even decades after leaving for the suburbs. That's the deal in Fox Chase, where you grow up to love your favorite local bar as much as you loved the local ballfields as a kid. It's a place near the suburban county line where the name of your parish is almost more important than the name of the street your house is on.</p>
<p>A generation of Fox Chase Proud came of age there in the 1980s, in a jumble of post-war twin houses teeming with young families of deep Catholic faith. Drawn by bigger, brighter, newer houses north of Cottman Avenue and west of Roosevelt Boulevard, they made this Philly's version of an Irish enclave in New York's outer boroughs.</p>
<p>Jamie Cunningham, as the family called little James, moved into a small twin on Lawndale Avenue in the late 1970s. His dad, the elder James, was a shipping company worker and eucharistic minister at church. Jamie and his brother and two sisters were surrounded by kids of cops, kids of legal secretaries, and kids with stay-at-home moms who made sure the family knew that attending Sunday Mass was not optional.</p>
<p>"We both moved in within a week of each other," said next-door neighbor Mike Bruzas, whose dad worked in an auto parts factory. He and Jamie became grade school classmates and lifelong best friends, along with a third friend, who lived around the corner and was the son of a cop. "You've seen the movie Stand By Me? That always reminded me of our childhood."</p>
<p>St. Cecilia's was a concrete monolith on bustling Rhawn Street, where banks, bars, houses and water ice shops look like specks as you motor through the heart of Fox Chase. When kids weren't there for class or Mass, they turned asphalt avenues and tucked-away industrial lots into their blessed playground.</p>
<p>"We just owned the street, you know?" Kristen Ott said, of endless days with big brother Jamie and his pals in their Lawndale Avenue cul-de-sac kingdom.</p>
<p>"We had a big field behind the house that was owned by Conrail? We would go down there with all our friends and we would make forts all summertime," said Ott, now a 44-year-old mom. [BIRTHDAY 9/19/73]"There was a cardboard factory at the other end and we would steal cardboard. And then there was a hill, we called it golfer's hill, we would go down the hill and go sledding behind my mom's house. We used to walk the railroad tracks."</p>
<p>Just two years younger than Jamie, Kristen was often in the mix with her big brother and his St. Cecilia's crew.</p>
<p>"I would go down there on my bike, skateboard, whatever, and we would play street hockey," said a friend from three blocks away, Kevin Emery, who's now 46. Sometimes the gang would linger under their favorite group of trees and dig dirt or tease each other in the woods by the tracks.</p>
<p>"We all sort of busted each other's stones coming up," Emery said. "That's just the way it was back then. We were always this, that, 'Your Mom' jokes, the typical stuff."</p>
<p>Jamie was quick witted. Sharp. But with a smile so sweet that in some faded photographs, his dirty-blonde mug took over the whole picture.</p>
<p>Each morning, Kristen and Jamie would leave for St. Cecilia's on foot, picking up classmates along the way. Their dad would tag along as far as the SEPTA bus stop, where he began a long commute into work downtown.  Jamie never walked out the house without tucking in his shirt or making sure his hair was neatly combed.</p>
<p>"He was a tiny little kid, always had his hair parted to the side," said classmate Louie DiNofa, now 46, who remembered "Jimmy" as a good kid. "I'm a little Italian guy that looked like a mobster," DiNofa joked, "he looked like a politician."</p>
<p>Jamie was an excellent, curious student. And from the time he was little, he showed a precocious empathy for people.</p>
<p>"I'd put him in the yard out back, and anybody out in the street he'd talk to them," said his mother, Donna Cunningham, who said grateful elderly neighbors often had him over for pancakes.</p>
<p>"Jamie was that 'old man' that could talk to anybody," said his sister, Kristen.</p>
<p>In 1981, officials with the archdiocese thought a good associate pastor for this community would be James Brzyski, a young man just four years out seminary and whose father had been a Philadelphia cop.</p>
<p>Brzyski had already abused children at his first church out of seminary -- Saint John the Evangelist in Lower Makefield. Over seven years at both churches, he would abuse anywhere from 17 to 100 children, prosecutors discovered decades later, when it was too late to prosecute or sue a soul.</p>
<p>Brzyski was a 6-foot-five colossus who weighed 220 pounds. He favored a certain type of boy that was quite the opposite: "Shy, docile, bright and intelligent and … all physically attractive," in the words of a priest quoted by prosecutors decades later. His prey: Children as young as 10, 11 and 12 years old.</p>
<p>One target became John Delaney. The youngster played soccer on the same team as Jamie and was an altar boy alongside him, among a group of several dozen to help Brzyski with Mass.</p>
<p>"I came from a broken home, I was a shy kid, I was a little kid," said Delaney, who like Brzyski, was the son of a cop.</p>
<p>Brzyski abused Delaney and others in the sacristy, the grade school, the rectory and elsewhere. Delaney was just 12 and weighed 80 pounds when Brzyski raped him in the rectory, prosecutors would learn decades later.</p>
<p>The priest revealed to the altar boys an intimidating side even when he wasn't squirreled away behind closed doors fondling his victims.</p>
<p>"I vividly remember, I think it was May procession practice. … There was incense. … All the altar boys were lined up," Emery recalled.  "It might have been after school one day."</p>
<p>Brzyski insisted that boys in procession hold their palms together so that fingers pointed to the sky. Interlacing fingers was akin to pointing to the devil. Brzyski would punish you by wrapping his hands around a boys' knotted fingers and squeezing until the knuckles felt like they were cracking.</p>
<p>But on this day in May, the priest did something far scarier. And all because a boy giggled or whispered during practice.</p>
<p>"I vividly remember him grabbing [him], throwing him through the air into a confessional," Emery said. "The confessional had curtains where the parishioner went in to kneel down, a velvet curtain. I remember him feet in the air, going through the curtain and slamming into the confessional."</p>
<p>Emery was a physically big kid and not so easily frightened. But this? It was terrifying.</p>
<p>"Threw this kid across from the aisle into the confessional. Maybe five, 10 feet. I'll never forget that," Emery said. "That was something that really stuck in my head: Holy shit, what is this guy doing? I was petrified after that."</p>
<p></p>
<p>For all his being a slight kid with a soft heart, Jamie had outsize guts. He was goalie on the Fox Chase soccer team he won the all-city championship for kids under 14.  </p>
<p>"The goal was big, we were little kids," said teammate John Mullen, who played with Cunningham and Delaney for about four years. "He was a great goalie."</p>
<p>Jamie didn't flinch if he thought the right move was to leave the goal untended and challenge an oncoming opponent. He knew how to fake a shooter. And he could just as brazenly sit back for the 40 percent chance of saving a shot at net.</p>
<p>"It takes stones to play goalie," said Mullen. "If an offensive player from another team is coming at you with a ball, you have a couple of choices. It's a game of guts."</p>
<p>He concealed that toughness at school and at home. He was a "good son" who never fought. Never talked back. If anything was amiss at church, family members say he didn't show it.</p>
<p>That included the one snowy week that his mother would remember, only in retrospect, with considerable anxiety.  Jamie had to go help Brzyski with Mass every morning that week before heading to school, he said. Told his mom it was "punishment" for something. But he seemed like his happy-go-lucky self, so no one gave it much thought.</p>
<p>At the local recreation center on Rhawn Street, however, the obedient boy would find a way to avoid church.</p>
<p>"Sometimes we would say we're going to church," his sister recalled, "but we would sit up at the Fox Chase Rec and we'd sit up there for like an hour. And sometimes, we'd argue [over] who's going into the church to go grab the Mass paper to say we had gone to church."</p>
<p>Brzyski kept the boys quiet through what prosecutors described as savvy manipulations. He told several boys their parents were aware of and sanctioned the abuse. He also paid frequent visits to their homes, making parents proud that the parish priest was coming by.</p>
<p>One victim especially terrified by this was altar boy Jimmy Spoerl. The handsome youngster was abused starting in fifth grade and became what he sensed was Brzyski's "favorite molestee." Brzyski would pull Jimmy out of class and abused him in the rectory, Spoerl told the grand jury two decades later as he battled addiction and depression.</p>
<p>"He was afraid to go to school," said his mother, Cass Spoerl, in an interview, "and he was afraid to come home."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Spoerl's abuse came to an end as an eighth-grader in 1984 after Brzyski "suddenly disappeared" from St. Cecilia's.</p>
<p>The church lied to parishioners.</p>
<p>"They said he had a mental breakdown," said Cass Spoerl. "It said so in the parish bulletin."</p>
<p>In reality, a whistleblower priest had given church officials evidence that Brzyski had abused children at his first parish. Brzyski admitted to several acts of sexual misconduct; the archdiocese sent him to Saint Luke Institute in Maryland, a Catholic treatment center for priests. The facility's priest-director said Brzyski demonstrated "pedophilia" and recommended intensive treatment, noting the church's potential exposure to prosecution.</p>
<p>Then-Cardinal Krol had harsh words: "His alleged conduct suggests a wolf in sheep's clothing – who serves as Satan's agent for 187 perdition and not Christ's alter ego for salvation," he wrote in the margin of a personnel memo prosecutors reviewed two decades later.</p>
<p>But after Brzyski bailed out of St. Luke's against archdiocesan wishes, and then spurned the church's desire that he remain in ministry, the church told nothing to police or worshipers. And in 1986, a top lieutenant to Krol issued a memo ordering that no effort be made to find any Brzyski victims at St. Cecilia's.</p>
<p>Spoerl's mother could not understand disturbing changes in her son's personality as he came out of grade school. Nor could she understand why Brzyski turned up on her doorstep, after having vanished from the parish.</p>
<p>She answered the door. The priest seemed off-kilter. Sweaty. Not well.</p>
<p>"He just said, he 'just came for a visit.'"</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Jim Cunningham's marriage was falling apart in the summer of 2008 when, at a family vacation off the coast of North Carolina, he said something so shocking that people wrote it off as a big drinker's raunchy, over-the-top stab at ribald humor.</p>
<p>He had come a long way since grade school. Now 34, Cunningham was doing well professionally, even as his personal life was turning messy.</p>
<p>After St. Cecilia's, he went to Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Bensalem for three years and finished high school at Cardinal Dougherty, where he won a news reporting contest and scholarship at KYW Radio.</p>
<p>Cunningham spent summers working on freighters and put himself through Temple University for a bachelor'. Then came Holy Family University and a Master's in psychology.</p>
<p>Along the way, he transformed into a man eager to give voice to people in need.</p>
<p>When a Temple teachers' strike shut down classes in 1990, Cunningham was at the forefront of student demonstrations. He saved clippings of photos in the Inquirer and the Daily News showing him standing tall in front of a group of protesters with his fist raised high and, in another shot, holding a banner urging the ouster of the university president.</p>
<p>"He paid for college himself," his mother said. "He was so mad that they were on strike!"</p>
<p>At work, he had ascended to supervisor of addictions treatment at Bucks County Correctional Facility.</p>
<p>"He was a very gifted drug and alcohol counselor," said attorney Frank Rothermel, a former federal prosecutor who became friends with Cunningham when they both served as Democratic committeemen in the 2000s. Cunningham even got hired to help police learn how to defuse psychologically volatile standoff situations.</p>
<p>"He was a SWAT negotiator," Rothermel recalled. "Talked people out of committing suicide."</p>
<p>The winter before that family summer vacation, Cunningham and Rothermel had won township supervisor seats in Northampton Township, giving Democrats a voice in local government for the first time in the town's 280-year history. They won with help from a local scandal and backlash against President Bush.</p>
<p>"It was lightning in a bottle," Rothermel recalled. His parents and siblings wore campaign buttons and helped distribute campaign flyers.</p>
<p>But Cunningham had developed a drinking problem in his 20s after becoming the father of two boys. And two weeks after that local election win, his wife filed for divorce.</p>
<p>Still, he continued to thrive at the prison, in what was a very high-burnout line of work.</p>
<p>"Jim was able to be real and true and talk to them from the heart, and that's truly a gift," said Bucks County Commissioner Diane Ellis-Marseglia, a Democrat and a clinical social worker who became friends with Cunningham over the past decade.</p>
<p>While the drinking did not interfere with his work but intensified his salty sense of humor, among other things. And so, that day over the July 4th holiday week in the Outer Banks, the family thought Jamie was being nothing more than uncouth.</p>
<p>"Everyone was drinking beer and having a good time," recalled Jonathan Ott, his brother-in-law.</p>
<p>"We were all there," said his sister, Kristen.</p>
<p>The exact words that tumbled out of Jamie's mouth are a vague memory.</p>
<p>"Something to the effect of a man having sex with him as a child," Jon recalled. A priest, he said. But Jamie offered no other details.</p>
<p>"He had such a great sense of humor you didn't take it seriously," Jon Ott explained. People thought to themselves, "'Oh, it's just Jimmy being funny.'"</p>
<p>If Brzyski had been on his mind, there had been recent occasions to stir memories.</p>
<p>In September 2005, Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham released a 418-page [CHECK CQ PAGE COUNT] grand jury report that spent 19 pages detailing Brzyski's abusive past and how the archdiocese had concealed what they knew about his pedophilia. Brzyski was among 63 priests found to have abused hundreds of children over several decades.</p>
<p>Brzyski "was one of the Archdiocese's most brutal abusers," the grand jury wrote. Victims "suffered a world of torment because their abuse remained secret and they were left to cope with its devastating consequences alone."</p>
<p>Three months before the Outer Banks trip, Brzyski again made the local news. An April 2008 story in the Daily News, "Fallen and Free," discussed the fate of 25 defrocked, unprosecuted, abusive priests from that 2005 report. Brzyski was roaming free in communities whose residents were unaware of his past. The archdiocese would not disclose the address they had on file for him.</p>
<p>Jon Ott did not know what might have been on Jamie's mind that day at the shore. But years later, one thing about that seaside outburst remained vividly clear: Cunningham was the only persons not laughing after he talked about being raped.</p>
<p>"He had tears in his eyes," Jon Ott said. "Like something was there. Like something was bothering him and he just wanted to get it out."</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Thanksgiving-time intervention hadn't stuck. Or the in-patient rehab around Christmas. And heart-to-hearts with his quasi-mentor at the prison, veteran addictions psychologist Bruce Schaffer, weren't doing the trick, either. Cunningham was in a bad way in July 2016 as he sat in his office at the jail, transfixed by the front-page story about Archbishop Chaput in front of him.</p>
<p>Schaffer, then 69, had worked for 18 years with Cunningham at the jail. Had liked him from the start, sensing he was an underdog. Schaffer loved underdogs.</p>
<p>"Old Head," as Schaffer was known inside the prison's walls, had become a reservoir of professional and personal advice for the supervisor young enough to be a son. The two had worked through many work challenges together and chatted about how things were going at home, too.</p>
<p>"He would share his life problems with me," Schaffer said.</p>
<p>Cunningham had sunken into functioning alcoholism.</p>
<p>In 2011, his divorce went through, but the marital split remained contentious. A new grand jury that same year again examined clergy abuse in the Philadelphia archdiocese and rebuked then-Cardinal Justin Rigali for failing to remove many credibly accused priests, despite promised reforms years earlier. Rigali subsequently remove 27 priests from active ministry.</p>
<p>In 2013, Cunningham lost his re-election bid in Northampton. He was in a new long-term relationship with a woman but this did not lessen his reliance on booze.</p>
<p>Cunningham knew he had a problem and tried rehab time and again. Sometimes, he seemed close to winning, like on May 4, 2014.</p>
<p>On that day on Facebook, with his page set so all posts would be public, he uploaded a photo of himself smiling broadly in racing bib #10583 alongside one of his two sons. They wore jerseys and medals from the day's 10-mile Broad Street Run in central Philadelphia.</p>
<p>But such moments did not last. And by 2015, things had reached a point where Schaffer was now initiating serious talks with Cunningham at prison about his alcohol dependency. Cunningham never disputed he was an alcoholic. But in one conversation, he went even beyond just talk about the addiction itself.</p>
<p>"I need to tell you something," he told Schaffer one day that year.</p>
<p>"Okay," Schaffer replied.</p>
<p>"I was molested by a priest when I was a little boy," he said. "My mother doesn't believe me."</p>
<p>As as longtime sex offender therapist, Schaffer had heard enough of these confessions to know what a real one looked and sounded like. Such memories can take decades to surface after childhood abuse. And to Schaffer, Cunningham's mood and body language said it all: His friend was not lying.</p>
<p>"I remember like it was yesterday," Schaffer said. "He didn't look at me. I could see the pain in his face. And there was a long pause. A long silence."</p>
<p>Cunningham seemed ashamed.</p>
<p>"Does that change the way you see me?" Schaffer recalled him asking.</p>
<p>"No, no," Schaffer replied. "Absolutely not."</p>
<p>Schaffer knew from a growing body of research about childhood trauma that sexual abuse could change the wiring in a child's brain. Cause lifelong problems that play out intensely later in adulthood. So he said he told him to tackle one demon at a time. Start with the drinking. Get yourself strong enough to then unwind the childhood trauma.</p>
<p>But the man across from him in that office was, at the end of the day, his boss as well as a friend. Schaffer was afraid to pry too deeply.</p>
<p>"Do I open this guy up," Schaffer thought, "or do I recommend he get professional help?"</p>
<p>On paper, both counselors were experts at such situations. But Schaffer held back from diving in with the full probing of a therapist.</p>
<p>"Take care of this professionally," he told Cunningham, squelching the other five words battling to come out of his mouth, Do you want to talk?</p>
<p>Schaffer didn't know the priest's name or that he had been among the worst abusers in Philadelphia. Just that it had happened at a church called St. Cecilia's. Cunningham had said nothing more, so Schaffer let it be.</p>
<p>"If I would have opened him up," Schaffer said, weeping during after his death, "maybe I could have saved him."</p>
<p>Soon after Schaffer worked with Cunningham's parents, his girlfriend, and others in the family to stage an intervention. After that came more rehab, again with help from his mom and others.</p>
<p>But in early 2016, Brzyski remained fresh on Cunningham's mind. He told two other people that he had been abused by a priest -- people who don't know each other.</p>
<p>"Jim and I were talking about when we were kids," recalled Sean Allen, a 29-year-old tattoo artist who Cunningham had counseled while in prison and later became his friend after being released. Allen, who has a long criminal record, said he viewed Cunningham as one of the few people he met in and out of prison who had treated him with humanity.</p>
<p>Cunningham had just gotten out of rehab when the pair met around January 2016. He looked good. "He seemed real good," Allen said.</p>
<p>The two men had both grown up in Northeast Philadelphia in Catholic families and parishes, even though their lives had taken wildly different paths. While talking things over, Allen said, he mentioned that he had been molested by a babysitter when he was young.</p>
<p>"Jim was like, 'That ain't right,'" Allen recalled.</p>
<p>The two wondered, as they spoke, under what circumstances would a kid have told his parents of being molested, Allen said. What if you were an altar boy, Allen asked?</p>
<p>That's when Cunningham caught Allen by surprise.</p>
<p>"I was taken advantage of when I was a kid," Allen remembered Cunningham saying.</p>
<p>"Knock it off," Allen replied.</p>
<p>"He was like, 'Shit like that can fuck you up,'" Allen continued. But the ex-inmate didn't want to make Cunningham feel uncomfortable so he dropped the topic.</p>
<p>"I didn't pry," Allen said, crying during an interview at his Frankford-area apartment.</p>
<p>A month or so later, the pair went out to eat. Again, Cunningham mentioned having been sexally abused. But he was vague beyond that, Allen said.</p>
<p>"I want to pursue something that's been bothering me for along time," Allen recalled Cunningham saying. It was about kids who had been sexually abused within the Catholic Church, he said.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Cunningham shared his secret with one of the county's most prominent elected Democrats, Ellis-Marseglia recalled. The two were talking frequently at that point about Cunningham's efforts to design a new therapeutic treatment program at the jail with money she had secured.</p>
<p>"He told me he had been abused by a priest," Ellis-Marseglia recalled. "I think he said he was talking about it with someone."</p>
<p>For Ellis-Marseglia, who had lost a daughter to suicide, such conversations were not atypical. She and Cunningham would occasionally discuss difficult personal matters. But she was taken aback, she said, by how matter-of-fact he sounded.</p>
<p>"I chalked it up to that he was a mental health professional," she said.</p>
<p>In March 2016, several stories about a major state criminal investigation into clergy abuse and concealment within the central Pennsylvania Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown made the front page of The Inquirer.</p>
<p>That same month, former St. Cecilia's Class of 1985 altar boy Jimmy Spoerl died after a decades-long battle with addiction and therapy funded by the archdiocese. Spoerl had testified a decade earlier about being abused by Brzyski, only to watch him walk free.</p>
<p>Cunningham attended Spoerl's funeral in April [CHECK CQ] at a Protestant church. He was very drunk when friends went out for drinks in Spoerl's memory, recalled Louie DiNofa.</p>
<p>"He was so drunk he really couldn't talk," DiNofa recalled. "I guess he was drowning his own sorrows a little bit that night. I don't think we knew that brzyski had gotten him at that point, either."</p>
<p>In July 2016, as Cunningham sat in his prison office, Brzyski was again in the news. He had in front of him a tabloid newspaper front page showing dueling images of Archbishop Chaput and an old friend from St. Cecilia's, John Delaney, onetime altar boy of the year.</p>
<p>By now, Delaney was out in the open about what Brzyski had done to him. He was advocating that summer for passage of a bill that would let private institutions be sued for abuse on their watch years earlier. The archbishop had been fighting it after the House passed it in April 2016, amid outrage over a state grand jury probe that unveiled decades of clergy abuse and concealment in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnston in central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Delaney requested and was granted a meeting with Chaput, a man he saw as standing in the way of passage. The archbishop canceled, however, when Delaney told the press.</p>
<p>Cunningham showed Schaffer the picture and said Delaney was a friend -- one of two kids abused by the same priest as him, and at a church called St. Cecilia's. Cunningham wondered if Schaffer might want to meet him; his friend had had a rough life, having spent time in jail and kicking addiction. Cunningham would be meeting Delaney for dinner, he added.</p>
<p>The same day that July 15, 2016, story was published, Cunningham posted a snapshot of the front page onto his Facebook page for friends to see.</p>
<p>"Chaput is a coward," he wrote. Another attempt to exert power and control over a victim. Please give John-Michael Delaney closure on this chapter."</p>
<p>Others soon chimed in. Cunningham's thought string became a screed.</p>
<p>He turned Chaput's argument for canceling on Delaney - that the meeting had been pastoral in intent, not public - against him.</p>
<p>"Last time John went to a 'pastoral' meeting," Cunningham wrote, 'he and many of us got literally fucked."</p>
<p>He and Delaney had been altar boys together and soccer teammates, too. "Played on the yard together," he wrote. "This makes me fucking sick."</p>
<p>Then, a strike at Brzyski.</p>
<p>"His rapist presided over my great grandmothers (sic) funeral. A devout Catholic, who I loved very much, would be rolling in her grave now. Disgusted."</p>
<p>Three days later, in the middle of a Monday afternoon, Cunningham again went to Facebook. Again, his post was set to be seen by friends. But this time, there was no holding back.</p>
<p>"So I'm meeting my friend John-Michael Delaney this evening. He and I are friends from way back. I admire his courage and honesty. Therefore, I'd like to state publicly that Brzyski got to me, too. I've buried it over the years, battled alcoholism and depression (sic) John's fight brought it all up. And I'm with him."</p>
<p>He added one more line in an apparent reference to the death four months earlier of Jimmy Spoerl, whose funeral he had attended.</p>
<p>"Was sorry to see one friend die and another suffer."</p>
<p>Friends from grade school and elsewhere swarmed the comments section with statements of surprise, empathy, encouragement and, in some cases, simmering rage of their own.</p>
<p>"Wow," wrote his best buddy from next door, Bruzas.  "Sorry you had to go through that. It certainly changes my idyllic perception of our childhood. Let me know if you want to talk."</p>
<p>His sister, Kristen, blew him an emoji kiss. "We are always here for you! I hated that grade school for all the secrets!"</p>
<p>"Not easy," he wrote her back.</p>
<p>Old classmate Linda Matthias Hee, now a lawyer who had reconnected with him through Bucks County Democratic politics, also offered to help.</p>
<p>"Please let me know if I can do anything," Matthias Hee wrote. "I'm here."</p>
<p>"Defend me when I kill Brzyski?" Cunningham replied. "Can't imagine a jury would find us guilty."</p>
<p>She wrote nothing in reply.</p>
<p>Another classmate suggested he had been abused, too, but by a different priest.</p>
<p>"It wasn't Brzyski, but I (sic) too know your pain," he wrote. "They are the weak, we are the strong!"</p>
<p>One after another, mid-life adults who had survived the St. Cecilia's cauldron together vented feelings disillusionment. More than a few expressed pent-up anger over how little power they had had as children to stop Brzyski's decimating rampage.</p>
<p>"If we would have known back then and figured out something to do to stop that demented prick," wrote another long-time friend.</p>
<p>"Makes me sick to my stomach that we were all there at the same time and were too young and naive to band together," wrote still another.</p>
<p>"The school I moved to also had a priest in my high school … with a scum bag priest … who used to take kids down to OCNJ and do bad things to them," wrote another classmate. "Even with having my son in Catholic School I keep him away from priests and being an altar boy. Prayers with you Jim and to John."</p>
<p>They called Cunningham courageous. Told him he was strong. Cunningham may have believed this himself when he suggested his disclosure would be an act of cleansing.</p>
<p>"Only as sick as your secrets," he wrote.</p>
<p>That night, a group of St. Cecilia kids met him and Delaney to talk about it all. The class had held a few reunions already; this impromptu one was yet another Fox Chase back-in-time confab. They gathered at the Red Rooster, a local watering hole so old-school it still plays Sinatra on Friday nights, and you have to walk through a plume of sidewalk cigarette smoke just to get inside.</p>
<p>Cunningham walked through that door with his best friend from childhood. [check sourcing] He was in anguish, inebriated, but still able to smile through all the pain.</p>
<p>"It was a bad couple of days," said Delaney, who spent the better part of the next two days with Cunningham and would hear from him a lot as he struggled in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Delaney had gone public with his abuse in 2005, after appearing in the Philadelphia grand jury under the pseudonym "Sean."</p>
<p>"He was in a dark place," Delaney said. " A place that I knew well."</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The final straw for Jim Cunningham came on a weeknight in a rented apartment.</p>
<p>He and his long-term girlfriend had broken up. He has pushed through another inpatient rehabilitation program with help from his family. And Schaffer thought Cunningham might finally have had a shot at getting better.</p>
<p>This time in rehab, Cunningham told treatment center therapists about the abuse, he later told Schaffer. He received Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which helps people with post-traumatic stress disorder stop replaying the sights, sounds and feelings triggered by a scary memory.</p>
<p>"Looked good," Schaffer said of the one Sunday he visited Cunningham in treatment, in the presence of Cunningham's brother and a nephew. When he got out, Cunningham was on an anti-alcohol drug, Naltrexone, which makes you sick if you drink while taking it.</p>
<p>"That's great," Schaffer told him.</p>
<p>But the workload at the jail was high. Cunningham was asked to design a new program. Schaffer said he helped him do it, while keeping tabs on his friend's efforts to remain alcohol-free.</p>
<p>"Jim," Schaffer asked one day a few weeks after his return to the prison, "you still on that Naltrexone?"</p>
<p>"No," Cunningham said. "I stopped it." He had been going to a lot of support meetings, he reportedly said, and thought that was enough.</p>
<p>"That's a mistake," Schaffer told him.</p>
<p>He did not listen.</p>
<p>Schaffer had figured Cunningham for an underdog years earlier because of his penchant for poor decisionmaking. Now, he felt his friend was flat-out self destructing.</p>
<p>"That's when he really fell apart," Schaffer said. "He fell apart psychologically."</p>
<p>Both men were fired that winter. Schaffer, a 30-year veteran contractor at the jail, continued to work on consulting jobs across Pennsylvania, but Cunningham struggled. His mother got him an apartment in a three-story Victorian in quaint Doylestown. He was dating someone he had met in rehab. He could not find a comparable job.</p>
<p>At Christmas xxxxx FACE BOOK POST OF MOM….</p>
<p>In January, though, he was in such dire straits he reached out to his sister, Kristen, who long ago had moved with her family to Reading, an hour and a half away.</p>
<p>"He needed $1,500," Kristen Ott said. "He was talking about having job interviews, but he didn't have gas money. I was sending him Wawa gift cards."</p>
<p>He and Schaffer also checked in with each other in a meeting around that time at Red Lion Diner. By then, he had found a job that paid less than he had been making.</p>
<p>"He said that he was totally broke," Schaffer recalled. "He was about to get evicted, he had no cable. They were going to repossess his car because he was back on his car payments. So I gave him a couple of hundred dollars."</p>
<p>Schaffer again offered to give him money later that month.</p>
<p>"No, no, no please don't do that," Cunningham said. A week later, Cunningham texted that he had lost the new job.</p>
<p>At 9:55 p.m. on Thursday, February 9th, Cunningham went to Facebook. This time, the post was set for all the public to see.</p>
<p>"To all those I've helped, please remember me. To all those who judge and disparage and discount, fuck you."</p>
<p>Marita McNichol, a former St. Cecilia's youth sports counselor, posted the first worried comment.[check that]</p>
<p>"You ok cuz?" McNichol asked. So did others after her.</p>
<p>"No," Cunningham told them.</p>
<p>"What's up, brother ? What's up?" asked Delaney.</p>
<p>Police were dispatched to his apartment after being contacted by his mother, who feared Cunningham might hurt himself. For an hour he texted with officers as Facebook page lengthened with from concerned friends. Members of the Central Bucks Special Response Team, the very unit that he had guided as a standoff negotiations coach, also came to assist.</p>
<p>After that first hour passed, he left no doubt in everyone's mind about what, in his view, had brought him to this excruciating point.</p>
<p>"This is the face of being raped as a child."</p>
<p>Cunningham criticized members of his family, saying they had not believed him.</p>
<p>"I've been an alcoholic for twenty plus years keeping this bullshit to myself until recently."</p>
<p>"Jimmy please keep your head up," fellow altar boy Kevin Emery wrote. "One day at a time" (sic)</p>
<p>Cunningham took one more swipe at his family. That was it.</p>
<p>At one point, in texts with officers Cunningham threatened to shoot himself and police, Central Bucks Regional Police Chief James Donnelly said at the time.</p>
<p>Officers found him hanging inside a closet. No guns anywhere. The coroner declared it a suicide, listing time of death as 5:51 a.m. Donnelly, whose department was in charge, has refused to release the incident report or any information about that night, denying even Cunningham's mother's request for a copy of the incident report.</p>
<p>The next morning, word spread like a punch to the stomach that Cunningham had killed himself.</p>
<p>Kristen Ott threw her phone when she got the call from her younger sister.</p>
<p>Bruce Schaffer was standing on a train platform in Fort Washington with his wife when his phone rang. He was almost beyond words.</p>
<p>"Jesus," he thought. "What the fuck."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on his Facebook page, a former inmate at Bucks County prison apparently had not yet heard the news. Cunningham would never see what he wrote.</p>
            <p>"...You treated me like a human being when I was in jail," he wrote, "when sometimes i didn't even feel like one …"</p>
<p>Hours later on the page, disbelief from one of his best buddies from St. Cecilia's, one of the Lawndale street-hockey -and-tree-fort boys.</p>
<p>"oh god no."</p>
