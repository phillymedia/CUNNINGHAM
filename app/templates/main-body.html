        <p>It was a terrible loss: a former altar boy, a prison counselor and hostage negotiator, a father and onetime Bucks County supervisor – dead by suicide. He was 45 years old. Handkerchiefs were out in the other pews. But in rows toward the back,
          fury 30 years in the making was boiling over.</p>
        <p>"No. I can't do it," Kevin Emery told the others. "We can't stay here for this."</p>

        <p>Like Cunningham, each had been students in the same Northeast Philadelphia parish school, St. Cecilia's, in the 1980s when the Rev. James Brzyski turned their church community into a stalking ground. Brzyski assaulted possibly more than 100 boys
          during a seven-year stretch at St. Cecilia's and another parish, a grand jury asserted, but never face prosecution.</p>

        <p>As far as any of Cunningham's boyhood friends had known, the scrawny bookworm with a million-dollar smile had been among the lucky ones to avoid the predator's reach. He had earned a Master's degree, built a career, even won a seat on his local
          board of supervisors. </p>

        <p>But in recent months, Cunningham had begun to share a torment: long-ago abuse at the hands of Brzyski. Friends and family watched his life come apart. His anguish reached unsustainable intensity several nights before this February funeral in Warrington
          when, surrounded by the Bucks County SWAT team he had once advised, Cunningham posted a final note on Facebook: "This is the face of an adult raped as a child." </p>
        <p>Emery had captured a screenshot of that Facebook message to the smartphone in his pocket and thought about the message as three Catholic priests hovered near Cunningham's casket. </p>
        <p>This was the second funeral in a year for the St. Cecilia's crew. Jimmy Spoerl, who as an altar boy was raped by Brzyski, had died in March 2016 after a lifetime of trauma and addiction. Another victim, John Delaney, sobbed in a rear pew at Cunningham's
          funeral. A fourth victim, Gerad Argeros, stayed home from both funerals, afraid it would stir his own demons.</p>
        <p>These men and those who loved them were among the lost generation of St. Cecilia's. Casualties of long-hushed childhood horrors that seemed to have no end. Yet since being labeled a pedophile and walking away from the church decades ago, their
          alleged abuser roamed the country a free man. There was no dispute he might have inflicted more damage on children than any priest in Philadelphia in a half century. </p>
        <p>As many as one in four girls and one in six boys endure some form of sexual abuse by age 18. Many hide, ignore or repress the memories. Countless children remain silent for years until they either confront their secret trauma or are destroyed
          by it. Like Cunningham. </p>
        <p>As Emery and others left the funeral Mass in protest, Cunningham's mother, a Catholic church secretary, remained in the front row in shock. A few pews behind her was Mike Bruzas, another St. Cecilia's alum and Cunningham's best friend. Brzyski
          had never targeted him, but he too felt damaged.</p>
        <p>"Why did I survive and they didn't? Was it just luck?" Bruzas would wonder for months. "It just doesn't seem fair that he kind of stole a part of everyone's childhood."</p>
        <p>Brzyski, his whereabouts long a mystery, would shock them all a few months later and thousands of miles away.</p>

        <p> Cunningham I: CHILDHOOD IN FOX CHASE:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church was more than a sanctuary full of pews. Its buildings -- the rectory, school, gym and the church itself -- blanketed an entire block in Fox Chase, a neighborhood so full of young Catholic families in the 1980s
          that an estimated 10,000 worshipers made it among the region's largest at the time. </p>
        <p>The Rhawn Street compound, as one altar boy called it, was the center of prayer and social identity. Grade schoolers spent almost as much time there as they did at home in the heavily Irish-Catholic community. </p>
        <p>The neighborhood was full of cops and firefighters, factory workers and secretaries, and stay-at-home moms. They raised their children with sometimes unyielding discipline, some with an unflinching devotion to the church. Being an altar boy conferred
          status on a family.</p>

        <p> Cunningham's parents moved with their four children into a small twin on Lawndale Avenue in the late 1970s. His dad, James, was a shipping company worker and served as a eucharistic minister at Sunday Mass. </p>
        <p> Around the same time, Bruzas' family settled into the house next door. His father was an auto parts factory worker; Mike and Jamie, as Cunningham was known, became fast friends. A third boy, son of a cop, moved around the corner just a few weeks
          later. The trio became the Three Amigos of the neighborhood, playing all day long, sometimes in woods behind the house, sometimes stealing factory cardboard to make forts, walking on the railroad tracks.</p>
        <p> "You've seen the movie Stand By Me?" Bruzas said. "That always reminded me of our childhood."</p>
        <p> Jamie was a good student and dapper little guy who never left for school without tucking in his shirt or making sure his hair was neatly combed to the side.</p>
        <p>"I'm a little Italian guy that looked like a mobster; he looked like a politician," said classmate Louie DiNofa, recalling him fondly. </p>
        <p>He was a clever but kind soul, said his sister, Kristen Ott: "That 'old man' that could talk to anybody."</p>
        <p>Every morning, she and Jamie left for St. Cecilia's on foot, joining the other boys along the way. Their dad would tag along as far as the SEPTA bus stop, where he began his downtown commute. On weekends, the kids would make the same trek yet
          again, but this time for Mass. </p>
        <p> Obedience. Trust. Devotion to the faith. These were the values in Fox Chase. It was an ethos ripe to be exploited by a predatory priest.</p>

        <p> BRZYSKI I.</p>

              <div class="containerPhotoCaption" alignment="true">Rev. James J. Brzyski. From St. Charles Seminary, Priest Alumni of Philadelphia.</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The altar boy practice one afternoon turned explosive. The young priest was lording over the boys as they stood queued up in line. They knew he was militant about them hold their palms together so that fingers pointed to the sky. Interlacing fingers
          into a ball was akin to pointing to the devil, in the priest's eyes, and anyone who didn't get it right would suffer the consequences: Brzyski would wrap his hands around their knotted fingers until the knuckles felt like they were cracking.
          But on this day the priest filled them with terror. </p>
        <p>An altar boy in line was giggling. Brzyski grabbed him and tossed him, headfirst, through the velvet curtains of a confessional. </p>
        <p> "What is this guy doing?" Emery thought at the time. After that, he was petrified of the 6-foot-5 priest who supervised him and dozens of other altar boys.</p>
        <p>Brzyski was just 30 years old when he was appointed associate pastor of St. Cecilia's in 1981. The son of a cop and ordained just four years earlier, he seemed relatable because he was not an elderly monsignor. But his towering 220-pound frame
          was imposing. </p>
        <p>Only years later would parishioners learn that he had sexually assaulted children at his first assignment at Saint John the Evangelist in Lower Makefield – and was about to do the same with their own sons in Fox Chase.</p>


        <p>Brzyski favored a certain type of boy. "Shy, docile, bright and intelligent and ... all physically attractive" -- and as young as 10, a grand jury would declare years later. </p>
        <p>Brzyski also sought out children with fragile home lives or exceptionally devout parents, better to keep his sordid acts under wraps. This was a common strategy among pedophiles: They fished in troubled waters.</p>
        <p>Delaney fit the profile. Altar boy of the year, soccer player and son of a cop. His stepfather drank. His relationship with his mother wasn't good.</p>
        <p>"I came from a broken home," he said. "I was a shy kid, I was a little kid."</p>
        <p> He was just 12 and weighed 80 pounds when Brzyski raped him in the rectory, he told prosecutors years later. Over the course of three years, Brzyski molested him in the grade school, the rectory, and the sacristy, where priestly robes were hung.</p>
        <p>Gerad Argeros was the paper boy who dropped off the Bulletin every day at the rectory where Brzyski would rape him. His dad, a Teamster truck driver, and his mom, a part-time secretary, raised him and a sister in a house about a block away. With
          an aunt who was a nun, the church felt like home to him.</p>
        <p>Brzyski began molesting Argeros when he was 11. Once, the priest had Argeros face-down on the rectory floor. The boy would attend religion class later and come to think his terror was God's plan.</p>
        <p> "In the building 40 yards way from where I was raped was this mantra that God is this omnipotent, omniscient being who is steering everything that's going on," Argeros said. "And his envoy has me trapped in a room."</p>
        <p>Jimmy Spoerl had four brothers, a sister, and strict Catholic parents – the kind who were thrilled Brzyski visited their home and showed interest in their young son. They did not know Brzyski had begun abusing Spoerl in fifth grade and was removing
          him from class to molest him.</p>
        <p> Years later, Spoerl would explain why he had stayed silent about it. Once, he threatened to report Brzsyki's abuse to his parents. The priest's reply was a lie: That his mom and dad already knew -- and sanctioned it.</p>
        <p>"He was afraid to go to school," his mother, Catherine Spoerl, said in an interview this year, "and he was afraid to come home."</p>
        <p>Brzyski's victims did not confide in each other. Though they would later learn that their tormenter had a nickname among adults in the parish: Frisky Brzyski. One victim many years later told a grand jury that a priest walked into the sacristy
          once and saw Brzyski fondling the boy's naked genitals only to walk back out.</p>
        <p>Delaney was shocked by how many others Brzyski apparently had targeted.</p>
        <p>He was alone one day in the priest's rectory bedroom when he found a metal lock box in an armoire. Inside were photos of teen boys, many of them nude. Some were kids from St. Cecilia's. </p>
        <p>And then, suddenly, in 1984, Brzyski disappeared from Fox Chase.</p>
        <p> A whistleblower priest gave top church officials evidence that he had abused many boys at the prior parish in Lower Makefield. Brzyski admitted to archdiocesan officials "several acts of sexual misconduct," including with a 7th-grade boy. The
          church sent him to a Catholic treatment center for priests in Maryland where a top clinician said he demonstrated "pedophilia." </p>
        <p>The archdiocese, however, did not tell parishioners.</p>
        <p>"They said he had a mental breakdown," Catherine Spoerl recalled. "It said so in the parish bulletin." </p>
        <p> Then-Cardinal Krol privately described the priest's actions as those of a "wolf in sheep's clothing." But no effort was made to notify law enforcement. So when Brzyski walked out of treatment and abandoned ministry in 1985, he remained a free
          man as the law for prosecutions expired five years later. </p>
        <p> Not long after Bryzski left, one of Krol's top aides issued a memo ordering that no effort be made to find any victims at St. Cecilia's.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>VICTIMS&lt;&lt;&lt; </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> The furor over clergy sex abuse may have been ignited in 2002 by revelations in the Boston archdiocese, but the patterns of conduct and long-term impact on victims seemed to follow the same path worldwide. Children who are sexually assaulted often
          wrestle silently for decades, unable to understand or process their abuse. Some blame themselves, some question their sexuality, many plunge into destructive addictive behavior. Clergy abuse carried an additional taboo: Victims were being attacked
          by a Man of God.</p>
        <p>Delaney and Spoerl each battled drugs, alcohol or depression and began acting out as they left grade school and entered high school. Their families were flummoxed.</p>
        <p>Argeros, too, lost his way. A high school guidance counselor chided him for not performing up to his 139 IQ. A few years later, he dropped out of George Washington University.</p>
        <p>Once in the early 1990s, Argeros, then back from college, was in a Roxborough diner when he spotted Brzyski in a booth. They exchanged glances but no words. It shook him.</p>

        <p>For Delaney, a similar shock came around 1997. He and his then-wife were home in Mayfair with their first child, a boy. A well-meaning newspaper announcement had spread the word. The phone rang.</p>
        <p>"Hey. How are you doing?" the caller said. It was Brzyski, who then was living in East Falls and running a children's birthday party business.</p>
        <p> "What do you want?" Delaney said he demanded. "Why are you calling?"</p>
        <p>Brzyski said he had heard about the baby. "I'd love to meet him some time," he said. </p>
        <p>"Come out any time," Delaney said he replied. "But you're leaving with a hole in your head."</p>
        <p> Argeros began to lose his grip and grapple with suicidal thoughts. Living in New York and giving standup comedy a try, he bolted out of an open mic club one night in 1998 because the club's manager had touched his thight. He dashed to a friend's
          apartment and passed out. When he came to, he panted three words. They had to do with Brzyski.</p>
        <p> "He got me!" Argeros told his roommates. "He got me! He got me!"</p>
        <p>Later that year, on his 28th birthday, he phoned the rectory at St. Cecilia's.</p>
        <p> "I need to speak to somebody who's in charge," he told the woman at who answered the phone.</p>
        <p>"You have to tell me what this is about first," he said she told him. </p>
        <p>"I was raped in that room right next to where you're sitting by Jim Brzyski," Argeros said he replied.</p>
        <p>Soon after he met with Msgr. William Lynn, the man at archdiocesan headquarters who handled the highest-level personnel matters for then-Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Argeros told them his story. Their reply: no one else had come forward about
          Brzyski.
        </p>
        <p>A few years later, Spoerl finally told his mother. It was while Boston boiled with disclosures of rampant clergy abuse concealed by church bishops. Philadelphia prosecutors empaneled a grand jury to dig into the case files of the archdiocese here.
          Argeros, Delaney and Spoerl each secretly, and separately, testified about what Brzyski had done to them. Delaney and Spoerl reached out on their own. Argeros received a call from a prosecutor who had somehow heard of him.</p>
        <p>Cunningham was not known to that grand jury. Up till then, his own path had seemed, on the surface, to have been trouble-free. </p>
        <p>He attended Holy Ghost Preparatory School for three years before graduating from Cardinal Dougherty High. He worked summers on freighters to pay his way through a bachelor's at Temple University and a master's in psychology from Holy Family College.
          He led student protests during a Temple teacher strike that halted classes for weeks.</p>
        <p>By 30, he was married, had two boys, a career as a prison counselor, and the same winning personality everyone had seen in him as a boy. </p>
        <p>"The perfect life," in the eyes of Bruzas, his Fox Chase pal.</p>
        <p>At the Bucks County Correctional Facility, inmates came to view Cunningham as atypically kind and sympathetic. He also helped the Central Bucks County Response Team and police help defuse volatile standoffs.</p>
        <p>"He talked people out of committing suicide," said Frank Rothermel, an attorney and friend. </p>
        <p>But around 2001, Cunningham had started drinking heavily. Friends and family say it became noticeable as the national clergy abuse scandal began catching fire and he was the new father of two little boys. But no one suspected there was a connection.
          Friends and family chalked up his excessive drinking at gatherings to the stresses of life.</p>

        <p>When Philadelphia's clergy abuse grand jury findings came out in 2005, the St. Cecilia's community was dumbstruck. </p>
        <p>Church officials were accused of reassigning abusive priests and concealing what they knew from parishioners for decades. But no one was charged; time had run out under state law to charge the church or any clergy. </p>
        <p>A shocker to the Fox Chase community: Brzyski was among 63 named priests -- "one of the Archdiocese's most brutal abusers" in the grand jury's words. The accusations against him spanned 19 pages of the 418-page report issued by District Attorney
          Lynne Abraham.</p>
        <p>Kevin Emery got chills as he read about it in the newspaper. "I almost threw up," he said.</p>
        <p>Cunningham's mother asked her son bluntly if Brzyski got him, too. </p>
        <p>No, he said. </p>
        <p>She accepted this. But would wonder about a snowy week in the early 80s, when Jamie marched from their home each day to serve pre-dawn Mass with Brzyski. </p>

        <p>The priest had ordered it as "punishment," was all the boy had told his mother at the time. Cunningham seemed to spend an unusual amount of time there, a delay that he explained away by saying nuns had treated him to a cup of cocoa.</p>
        <p> The family rallied around Cunningham when, two years later, he won a historic Democratic seat on his local board of supervisors in Republican Northampton Township. Two weeks later, his wife filed for divorce.[CHECK CQ]</p>
        <p> The next summer during a beach vacation with extended family in North Carolina, Cunningham stunned his brother his two sisters and their spouses. Inebriated and dejected about his failing marriage, he blurted out "something to the effect of a
          man having sex with him as a child," recalled Jonathan Ott, his sister Kristen's husband. And that a priest had done it, Ott recalled.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It was an uncomfortable moment. His mother and father weren't there when he said it. Everyone was drinking so most dismissed the comment as a raunchy stab at humor. But Ott was troubled. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"He had tears in his eyes," Ott remembered. "Like something was there. Like something was bothering him and he just wanted to get it out."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>CUNNINGHAM COMES UNGLUED:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For years after the 2005 grand jury report, the archdiocese maintained it had gotten tough on abuse. Then came a 2011 grand jury's rebuke of then-Cardinal Justin Rigali. It castigated him for failing to remove credibly accused abuser priests.
          Rigali subsequently removed 27 clerics from active ministry.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2013, Cunningham lost re-election. He was in a new long-term relationship but still drinking more than he should. By November 2015, he began to come unglued.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>His mentor at the jail, veteran addictions counselor Bruce Schaffer, was alarmed that his acolyte was showing up at work with the shakes from booze. Schaffer, 70, pulled him aside for a fatherly lecture. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"I need to tell you something," Cunningham said.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Okay," Schaffer replied.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"I was molested by a priest when I was a little boy. My mother doesn't believe me."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Schaffer didn't know what to make of the second statement. But he had heard enough abuse stories through the years to conclude the first one was true.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"He didn't look at me," Schaffer remembered. "I could see the pain in his face. And there was a long pause. A long silence."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Does that change the way you see me?" he asked Schaffer.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"No, no," Schaffer said. "Absolutely not."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Schaffer knew trauma research said sexual abuse could change the wiring in a child's brain. It often caused lifelong problems in adulthood, affecting relationships, feeding addictions, and making it hard to hold down jobs. Victims often didn't
          remember the actual abuse until decades later, when headlines or other stressors triggered unanticipated flashbacks. Once out, the memories could be hard to stuff back into a bottle.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Schaffer thought about probing but Cunningham was his supervisor. He instead told him to tackle one thing at a time, starting with the drinking. Schaffer and Cunningham's parents helped him into alcohol rehab.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But the abuse remained in Cunningham's thoughts. He began to talk about it to people on the periphery of his life while keeping people like his sister, Kristen, in the dark. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He gave a barebones account of his Brzyski abuse to a friend and former inmate, Sean Allen, in early 2016. Cunningham also mentioned it to Bucks County Commissioner Diane Ellis-Marseglia, a social worker and political liaison to the prison who
          had lost a daughter to suicide.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"He told me he had been abused by a priest," Ellis-Marseglia recalled.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In March 2016, Spoerl died after years of substance abuse. Cunningham went to the funeral. He was devastated. He began telling his parents that he, too, had been abused. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Are you sure?" his dad would say. "Are you just saying this because you're drinking?"</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In July 2016, a front-page Daily News story citing Brzyski fueled Cunningham's torment. It said Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, who had been pushing to defeat a bill to let adult victims sue institutions for old cases of child sex abuse,
          had abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Delaney, his old classmate, after Delaney had told the press.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Cunningham posted a picture of the article on Facebook and raged.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"Chaput is a coward. Another attempt to exert power and control over a victim. Please give John-Michael Delaney closure on this chapter."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>And he struck at Brzyski.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"His rapist presided over my great grandmothers funeral. A devout Catholic, who I loved very much, would be rolling in her grave now. Disgusted."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Three days later the lid came off.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"So I'm meeting my friend John-Michael Delaney this evening. He and I are friends from way back. I admire his courage and honesty. Therefore, I'd like to state publicly that Brzyski got to me, too. I've buried it over the years, battled alcoholism
          and depression. John's fight brought it all up. And I'm with him."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"Was sorry to see one friend die and another suffer."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Friends swarmed with condolences and rage. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"Wow," wrote Bruzas. "Sorry you had to go through that. It certainly changes my idyllic perception of our childhood. Let me know if you want to talk."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>His sister, Kristen, blew him an emoji kiss. "We are always here for you! I hated that grade school for all the secrets!"</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Another alum Linda Matthias Hee, now a lawyer, offered to help.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"Defend me when I kill Brzyski?" Cunningham replied. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"Makes me sick to my stomach that we were all there at the same time and were too young and naive to band together," wrote one classmate.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Only as sick as your secrets," Cunningham wrote.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Delaney spent the next few days by Cunningham's side. "He was in a dark place," he said. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> Cunningham spoke of how the drinking had ravaged him.</p>
        <p>"You know what I'm going through," he told Delaney. "Nobody else gets it. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE END</p>

        <p>In September 2016, Spoerl's mother spoke at a news conference across the street from archdiocesan headquarters. She and others, including Boston advocates portrayed in the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight, were pushing for the statute of limitations
          bill that Chaput was on the cusp of helping defeat in Harrisburg. The change to state law would have given adult victims the right to sue private institutions for the sexual abuse they had endured as children.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I buried my son five months ago," she said, trembling as tears poured out. And yet Brzyski was free, she said, "to do whatever he wants to do."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Delaney was there, too, and fragile in his own right. Losing Spoerl and then watching Cunningham struggle with his own public disclosure had rocked him. Estranged from his second wife, Delaney would soon leave Philadelphia for five months of intensive
          therapy and rehab in Arizona and California. He didn't want to be the next in his class to die.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Cunningham, meanwhile, was quickly losing grip of all he had held dear.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>His relationship with his longtime girlfriend ended around the time of his Brzyski disclosure. A second stint in rehab failed. He lost his job. His home. And by Christmas, he was penniless and living in an apartment rented by his mother, plagued
          by nightmares. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Once, caught up in a bad dream, he put his hands around the neck of his new girlfriend, a woman he had befriended in rehab. She would later tell his mother she was convinced he had post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

        <p>A few days before Valentine's Day, Cunningham reached one last time for the Facebook megaphone that had become his confessional. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He began to type just before 10 p.m. on Feb. 9: "To all those I've helped, please remember me."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Cunningham's mom contacted police. Cops arrived. He texted with them for an hour. The Central Bucks Special Response Team he'd advised got there, too. None would say what Cunningham texted during the standoff. On Facebook, however, he left no
          doubt.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>"This is the face," he wrote, "of being raped as a child."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Police found him hanging in a closet. A rosary lay on the bathroom floor. On the kitchen table a crucifix.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Kristen Ott threw her phone and fell to her knees when her sister called to say their brother was dead.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When Bruzas got the news that morning he began to bawl in the Center City office where he worked. He went home early on the train and cried in his wife's arms.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Amid the shock and mourning emerged a consensus. It had to do with Brzyski.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"He needs to pay," Emery said over the summer. "He's gotten away with so much. And you know, he's still out there. He's still a predator."</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>BRZYSKI DALLAS</p>
        <p></p>

        <p> At Serendipity Apartments in Dallas, neighbors knew him only as a retired salesman with vague ties to Philadelphia. Brzyski was a mercurial neighbor, sometimes friendly, sometimes nasty. He cared for a garden of ferns and flowers, a chihuahua
          named Precious, and a corgi named Buddy.</p>
        <p>He told stories. Sometimes about priests from Philadelphia. But he never said that he, too, had once been a cleric. Or that he'd been defrocked in 2004. As far as they knew, James was a retired copier-company employee with a nice nest egg -- the
          same thing he'd told residents at another Dallas community three years earlier before they discovered his past and ran him out.</p>
        <p>He enjoyed free Meals on Wheels deliveries. Neighbors figured him for a highly educated man with a brazen sexual appetite for young men. He would show them pictures of naked teenagers on his computer and say they were 18 or older. He liked to
          "fatten up" his boys, they would hear him say time and again.</p>
        <p>Neighbors had no knowledge of his nomadic past in Virginia, Wisconsin, California. That he had been hauled before the Philadelphia grand jury but refused to answer any questions about his alleged pedophilia. Nor did they know that he claimed during
          a drunk driving arrest in New Mexico that he was living only on a monthly Social Security disability check of $1,117. </p>
        <p>On Aug. 21, a reporter and photographer from The Inquirer and Daily News knocked on the door of his ground-floor apartment. Brzyski opened it just a few inches wide, revealing a bandage on his scalp. Grey stubble coated the unshaven, battered
          face of a 66-year-old who looked older than his years. </p>
        <p>Asked about St. Cecilia's he said just two words -- "Oh, no" -- and shut the door. Confronted again outside the apartment hours later, he was told that Jamie Cunningham had committed suicide and accused Brzyski of abusing him as a child. Brzyski
          scurried with his dogs back into his apartment and said nothing.</p>
        <p> It was an unusual day at the complex - the day of the historic solar eclipse. Neighbors had been outside peering at the sky as Brzsyki returned to his apartment. Tenants were stunned as word immediately spread of his past.</p>
        <p> Ten days later, on Sept. 1, Brzyski gave his dogs to an acquaintance and left his furnished apartment behind. He was seen walking away from Serendipity with only a single suitcase on wheels.</p>
        <p> An acquaintance who spoke with him right before he left said Brzyski was downcast. "I'm either on the verge of suicide," Brzyski reportedly told the acquaintance, "or a nervous breakdown."</p>

        </div>
        <p> Thirteen days later, police found Brzyski's body in a Fort Worth motel room. A housekeeper found him on the floor, empty bottles of vodka, pill vials and paperwork strewn about. </p>
        <p> Pathologists found antidepressants and alcohol in his bloodstream. But not in quantities high enough to suggest an overdose. He had an enlarged heart, too. They struggled for weeks before concluding that he had died of an accidental heart attack.</p>
        <p>No one claimed Brzyski's body. It was shipped away for county burial.</p>
        <p>One of his Dallas neighbors, Vivian Galbraith, told investigators she and Bryzski had been friends for about three years but knew nothing of his past. The medical examiner had called her the day he died because she was listed as a witness on forms
          Brzyski had completed saying he wanted his body donated to medical research.</p>
        <p> "He was a human being but apparently had something wrong with him and his demons," Galbraith explained later in an interview. "I now recall him saying something, when he filled out the body donation form, about medical research. 'Maybe they can
          find out what was wrong with me.' At the time it didn't mean anything to me. But I think it does now."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Grief. Damage Unresolved.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Donna and James Cunningham sat in the darkened living room of their youngest daughter's Yardley home. Brzyski had died two days earlier, their son seven months before that. For months, Mrs. Cunningham had questioned her son's claim that he had
          been abused. Now, though, she and her husband felt certain that it was true – and that Jamie had tangled with the trauma alone for years.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"He was crying out for help," Donna Cunningham said, "And we failed him." </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>James Cunningham nodded as his wife spoke. "He kept saying he didn't want to disappoint us," he said of his son. "I've cried more in the last seven months than I've probably cried since I've been a little kid."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Donna Cunningham had been sleeping with the rosary beads retrieved from her son's apartment. Days were hard because she often imagined the actual moment when her boy took his life. To help, she had put Jamie's picture up as a screen saver on her
          computer at the Montgomery County parish where she worked as a secretary. The rosary brought peace, too.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I sleep good," she said. "I feel him there. I can feel him saying, you know, 'I'm sorry mom.'" </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Brzyski's death provoked dark jubilation on social media. But it was not cathartic in any lasting way to the people who felt most directly harmed by him. Whatever relief they felt was offset by reminders of the damage surrounding them.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Catherine Spoerl wondered if Brzyski had been a casualty of the very religious institution that had left her son exposed to him. The archdiocese covering up his alleged crimes by not telling police had been no favor even to Brzyski himself.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I hate to say it but he's another victim of the church," she said. "He should have gotten help a long time ago - and they just left him out there. He should have been in jail a long time ago."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It wasn't her church. Catherine Spoerl walked away long ago. So, too, had some of the boys of St. Cecilia's. Emery, DiNofa and Bruzas do not send their children to Catholic school. Bruzas still attends Mass but feels "leery" after everything at
          St. Cecilia's.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Brzyski's death came "40 years too late," Bruzas said.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>John Delaney had spent decades obsessed with thoughts of Brzyski. Now, he was dead. And by sheer coincidence, five days later, Delaney was about to walk into archdiocesan headquarters in Philadelphia for a meeting he had been seeking for more
          than a decade: a sitdown with the archbishop to discuss his abuse and the church's response. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As he prepared to meet with Chaput in Center City, Delaney was nervous. He had hardly slept. Breakfast was a soft pretzel, an energy drink and Marlboro Red cigarettes. He had done time in jail and battled addictions but somehow was still alive
          to fight another day. But he said he remained deeply wounded.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"My wife says I cry in my sleep. I call out in my sleep. I fight and kick and punch and cry," Delaney said. He wore a cross that hung from a chain around his neck – it was there only because, he said, old habits die hard. He said he also still
          recites the same prayer every night that he learned as a child: Now I lay me down to sleep/I pray the Lord my soul to keep/If I should die before I wake/I pray to God my soul to take.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Delaney said his complaint wasn't with Chaput himself, but rather the archbishop's public stance on efforts to deliver justice to victims. While expressing sympathy, Chaput had told the faithful just a few weeks after Cunningham's death that giving
          people greater rights to sue the church for past abuse would be "damaging" and an attack on religious and private institutions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Delaney spent about an hour with Chaput in the rectory of Ss. Peter and Paul Basilica, the cathedral adjacent to archdiocese headquarters. When it ended, Chaput appeared on the sidewalk in his clerical collar before disappearing onto church grounds.
          Delaney followed a few minutes later.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"He told me he was very sorry for what happened to me and what I'd had to go through in my life," Delaney said. "He said he hopes I'm able to get through all this in one piece."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The meeting had been cordial. But Delaney felt uneasy. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I don't know that right now I exactly know how I feel," he said.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To the outsider, Argeros may appear the strongest survivor. Married, with three children, and living in Brooklyn, he comes off as a put-together man who runs an event space connected to a buzzy Manhattan restaurant. He dabbles in the arts and
          has seen a therapist weekly for 20 years. But equanimity is fleeting.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I've spent decades," he said, "having to straddle this incredible sorrow and incredible pain and incredible rage." </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Brzyski's death was so shocking it moved him to tell his story publicly for the first time. He said the damage has lived inside him like time-release poison. Maybe, he thought, he could attack it by sharing his story with others in silent torment.</p>
        <p>"I thought that testifying [at the grand jury] would make me feel better. And it didn't. I thought that talking about it would make me feel better. And it doesn't. And his death. And it doesn't."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He's livid that most priests and the cardinals in charge of them avoided prosecution. He is unforgiving that worshipers did not do more to demand answers.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Down at that office, how many people in that office knew? In the main archdiocese office? Did the secretaries know? Who in the world would sit on that information?" he said, beginning to weep as he raged. "I'll tell you what you do. You go down
          to that office and you pull those people out of their desks and you say what the f--- are you doing?"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Argeros has kept stacks of journals that he may use to write a play and documentary about the abuse that nearly destroyed him – and others at St. Cecilia's.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Perhaps it will heal the damaged little boy he still cradles deep inside. </p>
        <p>It's hard not to wonder what life would have been like if Brzyski hadn't come to Fox Chase. All Argeros knows for sure is that the pain has had a life of its own.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"You don't get a pass. You don't get to say it once and then it's over. It lives in you," Argeros said. "And you open up the newspaper one day and there's a picture of this monster. And it looks like he crawled out of hell. And you have to see
          that face every day."</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p> To some, he was "Jim," the tough-talking counselor who had rescued them from drugs, booze and crime.</p>
      <p> To his mom and buddies in the old neighborhood, he was "Jamie," the sweet kid who built tree forts and played street hockey back in the St. Cecilia days in Northeast Philadelphia.</p>


      <p> To the angry and sullen men and women in the rear pews of this Catholic church in February, he was a symbol of lost innocence in a parish that had become a stalking ground.</p>
      <p> Cunningham took his life in the middle of the night in February after a months-long slide into despair. For the former altar boy, the end came inside a Doylestown apartment, surrounded by police and Bucks County SWAT team members he had once coached.
        Cunningham used to be the guy who helped cops save the most desperate of men.</p>
      <p> But he could not save himself.</p>
      <p> As several priests began the funeral Mass in February, friends in the back of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Warrington fumed.</p>
      <p> Like Jimmy, they were St. Cecilia grade school Class of 1985. They were youngsters while Father James J. Brzyski cut his swath of victimization through the parish - a period of unchecked abuse so vile that prosecutors would identify him years later
        as one of the most brutal sexual abusers to serve in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>
      <p> "No," said Kevin Emery and a few others in the pews. "I can't do it."</p>

      <p> He and the others had learned about the priest's predations in 2005 through a Philadelphia grand jury report that sent no one to jail. But as far as anyone knew, Jimmy -- a scrawny bookworm -- had been among the lucky ones to avoid the predator's
        reach.
      </p>
      <p> Jimmy had earned a Master's degree, become a dad, had a tough divorce. He built a respected career as a prison counselor and made history by winning a Democratic supervisor slot in the Republican heart of Bucks County.</p>
      <p> But he killed himself this year after making a startling admission on Facebook. Jimmy spoke out as Philadelphia's Catholic archbishop publicly fought efforts to extend legal rights for sexually abused children in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p> "This is the face of an adult raped as a child," he posted.</p>
      <p> Emery had a photograph of that post saved on his phone. He stiffened in the pew as priests hovered near the casket. A few pews away, altar boy John Delaney trembled with tears, a man who had gone public years earlier as a Brzyski victim. The St.
        Cecilia's kids had buried yet another altar-boy victim, Jimmy Spoerl, a year earlier.</p>
      <p> All had become the walking wounded of a grade school class for whom the horror associated with a single parish priest has seemed to have no end even as Brzyski has roamed free for decades. Even as the man enjoyed old age a meticulous garden, a brood
        of dogs, and Texas neighbors who knew nothing of his past 1,500 miles east.</p>
      <p> "We gotta leave," Emery recalled the group saying before walking out. "We can't stay here for this. This is wrong. It's a disrespect to him."</p>

      <p>ou never forget the neighborhood. Even decades after leaving for the suburbs. That's the deal in Fox Chase. You grow up to love your favorite local bar as much as the local ballfields as a kid. It's a place near the suburban county line where the
        name of your parish is almost more important than the name of the street your house is on.</p>
      <p> A generation of kids moved into Fox Chase in the 1980s in a jumble of post-war twin houses teeming with young mostly Irish-Catholic families of deep faith.</p>
      <p> Jamie Cunningham, as the family called little James, moved into a small twin on Lawndale Avenue in the late 1970s. His dad, the elder James, was a shipping company worker and eucharistic minister at church. Jamie was the oldest of two brothers and
        two sisters. They were surrounded by kids of cops, kids of legal secretaries, and kids with stay-at-home moms who made sure the family knew that attending Sunday Mass was not optional.</p>

      <p> "We both moved in within a week of each other," said Mike Bruzas, whose dad worked in an auto parts factory. He and Jamie became next-door neighbors, grade school classmates and lifelong best friends. Their third best pal lived around the corner
        and was the son of a cop.</p>
      <p> "We just owned the street, you know?" Kristen Ott said of their Lawndale Avenue cul-de-sac kingdom. They played all day long in woods behind the house, stealing cardboard or walking on the railroad tracks.</p>
      <p>"You've seen the movie Stand By Me?" Bruzas said. "That always reminded me of our childhood."</p>

      <p> Each morning, Kristen and Jamie would leave for St. Cecilia's on foot, picking up the neighborhood boys along the way. Dad would tag along as far as the SEPTA bus stop, where he began a long commute into work downtown. Jamie never walked out the
        house without tucking in his shirt or making sure his hair was neatly combed.</p>

      <p> "He was a tiny little kid, always had his hair parted to the side," said classmate Louie DiNofa, now 46, teasing that his buddy was a "good kid," if super clean-cut. "I'm a little Italian guy that looked like a mobster," DiNofa joked, "he looked
        like a politician."</p>
      <p> Jamie was sharp with words but had a soft smile on a dirty-blonde mug. He was an excellent student who showed a precocious empathy for people.</p>
      <p> "I'd put him in the yard out back, and anybody out in the street he'd talk to them," said his mother, Donna Cunningham, a stay-at-home mom who years later would take a job as a Catholic parish secretary. Elderly neighbors were so grateful for Jamie's
        attention they would have him over for pancakes, she said.</p>
      <p> In the words of his sister: "Jamie was that 'old man' that could talk to anybody."</p>

      <div class="dropBox"><span class="dropCap2">F</span></div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p> "Shy, docile, bright and intelligent and ... all physically attractive," in the words of a priest quoted by prosecutors decades later. His prey: Children as young as 10, 11 and 12 years old.</p>

      <p> Ordained in 1977, Brzyski had already abused children at his first parish out of seminary, Saint John the Evanglist in Lower Makefield, when the archdiocese made him associate pastor of St. Cecilia's in 1981.</p>

      <p> Over seven years at both churches, he would abuse anywhere from 17 to 100 children, prosecutors discovered decades later, when it was too late to prosecute or sue a soul.</p>
      <p> One by one, he set about abusing boys at St. Cecilia's. Kids including altar boy John Delaney who, like Brzyski, was the son of a Philadelphia cop.</p>

      <p> Delaney played on the same youth soccer team as Jamie and was among several dozen altar boys who served during Brzyski's time. He fit the target profile.</p>
      <p> "I came from a broken home," Delaney said. "I was a shy kid, I was a little kid."</p>

      <p> Brzyski abused Delaney and others in the sacristy, the grade school, the rectory and elsewhere. Delaney was just 12 and weighed 80 pounds when Brzyski raped him in the rectory, prosecutors would learn decades later.</p>
      <p> The priest was intimidating in other settings, too.</p>
      <p> "I vividly remember, I think it was May procession practice. ... There was incense. ... All the altar boys were lined up," Emery recalled. "It might have been after school one day."</p>
      <p> Boys in procession had to hold their palms together so that fingers pointed to the sky. Interlacing fingers was akin to pointing to the devil, in Brzyski's eyes, and would trigger a rage. Brzyski would wrap his hands around a boys' knotted fingers
        and squeeze until the knuckles felt like they were cracking.</p>
      <p> On this day, however, Brzyski threw a boy into a confessional for giggling.</p>
      <p> "What is this guy doing?" Emery remembered thinking. "I was petrified after that."</p>
      <p> At the time, his victims did not report [DOUBLE CHECK GJ REPORT] that they were being abused by Brzyski. Classmates like Emery, who were not assaulted, had no idea what the priest was doing to others behind closed doors. Prosecutors would learn
        years later that his victims felt shackled into silence by psychological manipulations..</p>
      <p> Brzyski told victims that their parents were aware of and sanctioned the abuse. He also paid frequent visits to their homes, making mom and dad proud that the priest saw something godly in their boys.</p>
      <p>This combination was especially chilling to classmate Jimmy Spoerl, who Brzyski had begun abusing in fifth grade. For nearly three years, the priest pulled the handsome boy out of class to abuse him in the rectory. Spoerl didn't tell his mother
        until decades later, when he decided to testify before the Philadelphia grand jury. [FIRST REFERENCE?]</p>
      <p> "He was afraid to go to school," said his mother, Cass Spoerl, in an interview after her boy's premature death last year, "and he was afraid to come home."</p>
      <p> If Cunningham was being abused, he, like the others, apparently told no one at the time.</p>
      <p> Jamie was not one to talk back or bring problems home, where strict discipline was a family norm. Plus, he was a tough kid, if also a studious one. His unflinching goaltending helped the Fox Chase Soccer Club win an all-city championship for kids
        under 14.</p>
      <p>"He was a great goalie," said teammate John Mullen. He said Cunningham had "guts" on the field.</p>
      <p>There was no sign, his mother said, of a change in personality. Of anything outwardly different to suggest the boy was being harmed.</p>
      <p> There was just a single snowy week that seemed a bit odd. One that Donna Cunningham would angst about decades later after prosecutors unleashed a torrent of revelations about Brzyski's rapacious sexual acts on children.</p>
      <p>Jamie had to leave for church every morning that week to help Brzyski with Mass, then head to class afterward. The priest ordered him there as "punishment" for something, Jamie told his mom, but didn't elaborate. He seemed like his usual self, so
        mom didn't give it much thought.</p>
      <p>When his parents weren't looking, though, the boy found one way to avoid the church they so revered. He would hide out at the recreation center across the street.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes we would say we're going to church," his sister recalled, "but we would sit up at the Fox Chase Rec and we'd sit up there for like an hour. And sometimes, we'd argue over who's going into the church to go grab the Mass paper to say we
        had gone to church."</p>
      <p>The only other thing anyone remembers came around eighth grade, the year Brzyski left St. Cecilia's. He no longer wanted the androgynous nickname so adored by his family.</p>
      <p>"Out of the blue, he said, 'Please don't call me Jamie anymore,'" Bruzas recalled.</p>
      <p>"Please," Cunningham insisted. "It's Jim."</p>
      <p> -------------------</p>
      <p> FIRST ADMISSION, ADULT YEARS</p>
      <div class="dropBox"><span class="dropCap2">C</span></div>
      <p>unningham's first known admission would not come until he was 34 years old, after Brzyski had been publicly named as an abuser. His career and public profile were soaring but his personal life was turning rocky.</p>
      <p>Cunningham bootstrapped his way into adulthood, attending Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Bensalem for three years and graduating from Cardinal Dougherty High school. Along the way, he was turning into a young man with a passion for channeling
        his intelligence toward giving voice to people in the world. He was proud when, during his senior year, he won a regional news reporting contest and scholarship at KYW Radio.</p>
      <p> He worked summers on freighters off the West Coast to help put himself through Temple University for a bachelor's and Holy Family University for a Master's in psychology.</p>

      <p> "He paid for college himself," his mother said. "He was so mad that they were on strike!"</p>
      <p>He had ascended to supervisor of addictions treatment at Bucks County Correctional Facility and was so respected he was hired to help the Central Bucks Central Response Team defuse volatile standoff situations with police.</p>
      <p> "He was a SWAT negotiator," said attorney Frank Rothermel, a former federal prosecutor who became friends with Cunningham as they both served as Democratic committeemen in the 2000s. "Talked people out of committing suicide."</p>
      <p>In the eyes of his best friend, Cunningham seemed to have it all by his mid 20s. He was married, had two boys, an ascending career, and a personality that could made friends anywhere, anytime.</p>
      <p>"I thought he had the perfect life," Bruzas said.</p>
      <p>Bruzas ended up hospitalized with depression. Cunningham paid him a visit. Was his lifeline.</p>
      <p>"Hang in there," he told him. "Things aren't as dark as they seem."</p>
      <p>But Cunningham had begun drinking heavily after becoming the father of two boys. It mystified those closest to him.</p>

      <p> In September 2005, the St. Cecilia's class was dumbstruck and shocked when Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham released a 418-page grand jury report about clergy abuse within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The grand jury spent 19 pages detailing horrific accounts of Brzyski's abuse of young boys between 1977 and 1984. With corroborating personnel files subpoenaed from church headquarters, Brzyski was found to be among 63 priests found to have abused
        hundreds of children over several decades.</p>
      <p> He was "was one of the Archdiocese's most brutal abusers," the grand jury wrote. Victims "suffered a world of torment because their abuse remained secret and they were left to cope with its devastating consequences alone."</p>
      <p>"I was sick to my stomach," Emery recalled when he read the newspaper stories that landed at the front door of his father's house.</p>

      <p>Cunningham's mother said she asked if Jamie had been abused. Her son's answer: "No." And he pushed forth with his professional ambitions.</p>
      <p> Cunningham made a bit of political history in November 2007 when he and Rothermel became the first Democrats in 280 years to win supervisor slots in Northampton Township.</p>

      <p> "It was lightning in a bottle," Rothermel recalled.</p>
      <p> He was working full-throttle at the prison, too, with something of an open-door policy with inmates that was humanistic.</p>

      <p> "Jim was able to be real and true and talk to them from the heart, and that's truly a gift," said Democratic Bucks County Commissioner Diane Ellis-Marseglia, a clinical social worker who became friends with Cunningham as he entered public life.</p>
      <p> But two weeks after his election victory, Cunningham's wife filed for divorce. Months later, Brzyski made headlines again when the Daily News questioned how he and so many other abusive priests had escaped arrest years earlier. And in the summer
        of 2008, Cunningham shocked his clan while they vacationed together off the coast of North Carolina.</p>
      <p> "Everyone was drinking beer and having a good time," recalled Jonathan Ott, his brother-in-law.</p>
      <p> "We were all there," said his sister, Kristen.</p>

      <p> Neither could recall the exact words that tumbled out of Jamie's mouth, but they remembered this much.</p>
      <p> "Something to the effect of a man having sex with him as a child," Jon Ott said.</p>
      <p>A priest.</p>
      <p> Jamie offered no other details. Relatives pooh-pooh'ed him. They figured it was a stab at raunchy humor, nothing more.</p>
      <p> Cunningham, however, was the only one not laughing.</p>
      <p> "He had tears in his eyes," Jon Ott said. "Like something was there. Like something was bothering him and he just wanted to get it out."</p>

      <p> BRZYSKI II</p>
      <div class="dropBox"><span class="dropCap2">B</span></div>
      <p>rzyski vanished from St. Cecilia's in 1984 and never returned.</p>
      <p> The church lied to parishioners about it.</p>
      <p> "They said he had a mental breakdown," Jimmy Spoerl's mom recalled. "It said so in the parish bulletin."</p>
      <p> In reality, a whistleblower priest had given top church officials evidence that Brzyski had been abusing children.</p>
      <p> Brzyski admitted to acts of sexual misconduct and the archdiocese sent him to Saint Luke Institute in Maryland, a Catholic treatment center for priests. The facility's priest-director said Brzyski demonstrated "pedophilia" and recommended intensive
        treatment, noting the church's potential exposure to prosecution.</p>
      <p> Then-Cardinal Krol had harsh words: "His alleged conduct suggests a wolf in sheep's clothing - who serves as Satan's agent for perdition and not Christ's alter ego for salvation," he wrote in the margin of a personnel memo prosecutors reviewed two
        decades later.</p>
      <p> But when Brzyski left St. Luke's against archdiocesan wishes, and rejected the church's request that he remain in ministry, officials told nothing to police or worshipers. In 1986, a top lieutenant to Krol issued a memo ordering that no effort be
        made to find any Brzyski victims at St. Cecilia's.</p>
      <p> Spoerl's mother didn't know what to make of disturbing changes in her son's personality as he entered high school. Nor could she make much sense of the visitor who turned up on her doorstep after the priest's vanquishment from Fox Chase.</p>
      <p>
        She answered the door. It was Brzyski. He seemed off-kilter. Sweaty. Not well.</p>
      <p> "He just said, he 'just came for a visit.'"</p>
      <p> ---------------------------</p>
      <p> COMING UNGLUED, SPEAKING OUT MORE AND MORE</p>
      <p>Cunningham was coming unglued.</p>
      <p>His divorce had gone through in 2011. Another Philadelphia grand jury report that year found even more priest abusers in ministry despite promised archdiocesan reforms. In 2013, he lost his re-election bid. All the while, Cunningham's drinking problem
        had become severe. He knew this and had done rehab time and again. On some days, like May 4, 2014, he seemed like he was close to winning.</p>
      <p> That day on Facebook, with his page set for all the public to see, he uploaded a photo of himself smiling in racing bib #10583 alongside one of his two sons. They had just done the 10-mile Broad Street Run in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>But by late 2015, he was struggling -- and started telling people in his outer orbit about having been abused as a child, while staying mostly mum to his closest relatives and oldest friends. He was confiding in people all had one thing in common:
        They had experienced extreme adversity themselves, or worked with people at their lowest.</p>
      <p>One admission came that fall inside the prison, when Cunningham was with one of his workers, Bruce Schaffer, 70, a veteran prison counseling contractor. The pair had worked together for 18 years [CHECK MATH]l.</p>
      <p>Inside, they called Schaffer "Old Head." The drug and sex offender therapist had become something of a mentor and confidant to the supervisor young enough to be his son. Schaffer had been initiating heart-to-hearts about Cunningham's drinking problem.
        One day, his supervisor blurted out something surprising.</p>
      <p>"I need to tell you something," he said, as Schaffer recalled it.</p>
      <p> "Okay," Schaffer replied.</p>
      <p> "I was molested by a priest when I was a little boy," he said. "My mother doesn't believe me."</p>
      <p> Schaffer had heard enough of these confessions to know what a real one looked and sounded like. Such memories can take decades to surface after childhood abuse. In Schaffer's mind, Cunningham's mood and body language said it all: His friend was
        not lying.</p>
      <p> "I remember like it was yesterday," Schaffer said. "He didn't look at me. I could see the pain in his face. And there was a long pause. A long silence."</p>
      <p> Cunningham seemed ashamed.</p>
      <p> "Does that change the way you see me?" Schaffer recalled him asking.</p>
      <p> "No, no," Schaffer replied. "Absolutely not."</p>
      <p> Schaffer knew from a growing body of research about childhood trauma that sexual abuse could change the wiring in a child's brain. Cause lifelong problems that play out intensely later in adulthood. So he said he told him to tackle one demon at
        a time. Start with the drinking. Get yourself strong enough to then unwind the childhood trauma.</p>
      <p> "Do I open this guy up," Schaffer thought, "or do I recommend he get professional help?"</p>
      <p>Cunningham did not tell him the name of the priest or what happened exactly. Just that the chuch was called St. Cecilia's. Schaffer was afraid to pry too deeply. This was a friend, but also his boss.</p>
      <p>"Take care of this professionally," he told Cunningham. What Schaffer really wanted to say: Do you want to talk?</p>
      <p> Schaffer worked with Cunningham's parents, girlfriend, and others in the family to stage an intervention that Thanksgiving. After that came more rehab, again with help from his mom and others.</p>
      <p>In January 2016, Cunningham seemed rested and better. But when he met with released-inmate-turned-friend Sean Allen, abuse was on his mind.</p>

        <p>Cunningham had counseled the 29-year-old tattoo artist while in prison. Allen, who has a long criminal record, said he viewed Cunningham as one of the few people he met in and out of jail who had treated him with humanity. Both were Northeast
          Philadelphia Catholic boys. As they gabbed. Allen mentioned that he had been molested by a babysitter when he was young.</p>
        <p> "Jim was like, 'That ain't right,'" Allen recalled.</p>
        <p> Allen wondered, aloud, under what circumstances a kid would have told his parents of being molested. What if, he asked Cunningham hypothetically, you were an altar boy?</p>
        <p>Cunningham's answer caught him by surprise.</p>
        <p>"I was taken advantage of when I was a kid," Cunningham told Allen.</p>
        <p>"Knock it off," Allen said.</p>
        <p>The dropped the subject, but not until Cunningham added one more thing: Being abused can mess up your life.</p>
        <p>When they met again a month or so later, Cunningham mentioned it again as something "bothering me for a long time," Allen recalled.</p>
        <p>He even confided in one of the county's most prominent elected officials, Democratic Commissioner Ellis-Marseglia. She was a social worker who had lost a daughter to suicide a decade earlier.</p>
        <p> "He told me he had been abused by a priest," recalled Ellis-Marseglia. He made the disclosure as the pair discussed Cunningham's effort to design a new therapeutic treatment program at the jail with money she had secured.</p>
        <p>"I think he said he was talking about it with someone."</p>
        <p>Weeks later came the funeral of Jimmy Spoerl. And with it, the beginning of the end for Jimmy Cunningham.</p>
        <p> --------------------------</p>
        <p> The final unraveling</p>
        <div class="dropBox"><span class="dropCap2">T</span></div>
        <p>he ink was barely dry on stories about a Pennsylvania attorney general probe into clergy abuse at the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown when Jimmy Spoerl died at a Philadelphia hospital in March 2016. He was 44. His body gave out after decades of battling
          addiction. Spoerl had told prosecutors he had been abused by Brzyski at St. Cecilia's.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Cunningham went to the Protestant church where Spoerl's mom held the funeral, in protest against the Catholic church. Afterward, he and a bunch of classmates toasted Spoerl at a bar. Cunningham was in bad shape that night.</p>
        <p> "He was so drunk he really couldn't talk," DiNofa, one of Spoerl's best friends, remembered about Cunningham. "I guess he was drowning his own sorrows a little bit that night. I don't think we knew that Brzyski had gotten him at that point."</p>
        <p>In July 2016, Cunningham was fixated on a front-page Daily News story about Brzyski as he sat in his jail office. It showed dueling images of Archbishop Chaput and an old buddy John Delaney, onetime altar boy of the year. Delaney had been pushing
          for a new law to let adult victims sue institutions for old cases of child sex abuse. Chaput was well on his way to successfully defeating the bill, now before the Senate.</p>
        <p> Delaney had requested and was granted a meeting with Chaput. The archbishop canceled when Delaney told the press.</p>
        <p> Cunningham showed Schaffer the news story. Told him Delaney was a friend and one of two other kids who were abused by the same priest who had abused him.</p>



        <p> The same day as that July 15, 2016, story was published, Cunningham went to Facebook and posted a photo of the newspaper's front page.</p>
        <p> "Chaput is a coward," he wrote. "Another attempt to exert power and control over a victim. Please give John-Michael Delaney closure on this chapter."</p>
        <p> Others chimed in. Cunningham became incensed, and hinted for the first time to his online friends that this was personal for him, too. He attacked Chaput for arguing that the planned meeting had been pastoral in intent, not public.</p>
        <p>
          "Last time John went to a 'pastoral' meeting," Cunningham wrote, 'he and many of us got literally fucked."</p>
        <p> He and Delaney had been altar boys and soccer teammates. "Played on the yard together," he wrote. "This makes me ----ing sick."</p>
        <p> Then, he struck at Brzyski.</p>
        <p> "His rapist presided over my great grandmothers (sic) funeral. A devout Catholic, who I loved very much, would be rolling in her grave now. Disgusted."</p>
        <p> Three days later, in the middle of a Monday afternoon, Cunningham held even less back when, again, he went to Facebook.</p>
        <p> "So I'm meeting my friend John-Michael Delaney this evening. He and I are friends from way back. I admire his courage and honesty. Therefore, I'd like to state publicly that Brzyski got to me, too. I've buried it over the years, battled alcoholism
          and depression (sic) John's fight brought it all up. And I'm with him."</p>
        <p> He added one more line: "Was sorry to see one friend die and another suffer."</p>
        <p> Friends from grade school and elsewhere swarmed the comments section with surprise, condolences, encouragement and simmering rage of their own.</p>

        <p> "Wow," wrote Bruzas. "Sorry you had to go through that. It certainly changes my idyllic perception of our childhood. Let me know if you want to talk."</p>
        <p> His sister, Kristen, blew him an emoji kiss. "We are always here for you! I hated that grade school for all the secrets!"</p>
        <p> "Not easy," he wrote her back.</p>
        <p> Old classmate Linda Matthias Hee, now a lawyer involved with Bucks County Democratic politics, offered to help.</p>
        <p> "Please let me know if I can do anything," Matthias Hee wrote. "I'm here."</p>
        <p> "Defend me when I kill Brzyski?" Cunningham replied. "Can't imagine a jury would find us guilty."</p>
        <p> Another classmate suggested he, too, had been abused -- but by a different priest.</p>
        <p> "It wasn't Brzyski, but I (sic) too know your pain," he wrote. "They are the weak, we are the strong!"</p>
        <p> One after another, mid-life adults who had survived the St. Cecilia's cauldron vented.</p>
        <p> "If we would have known back then and figured out something to do to stop that demented prick," another long-time friend wrote.</p>
        <p> "Makes me sick to my stomach that we were all there at the same time and were too young and naive to band together," wrote still another.</p>
        <p> "The school I moved to also had a priest in my high school ... with a scum bag priest ... who used to take kids down to OCNJ and do bad things to them," wrote another classmate. "Even with having my son in Catholic School I keep him away from
          priests and being an altar boy. Prayers with you Jim and to John."</p>
        <p> They called Cunningham courageous. Told him he was strong. Cunningham may have believed this himself when he suggested his disclosure would be an act of cleansing.</p>
        <p> "Only as sick as your secrets," he wrote.</p>
        <p> That night, a group of St. Cecilia kids met Cunningham and Delaney for beers at the Red Rooster, a Fox Chase watering hole so old-school it still plays Sinatra on Friday nights, and you have to walk through a plume of sidewalk cigarette smoke
          just to get inside. They often held reunions in there.</p>
        <p> Bruzas picked him up, took him there, and then took him back home. Cunningham was drunk the whole time. Yeah, he told Bruzas. I was one of the victims. But he asked his friend to change the subject. Some guys whispered about it at the Rooster
          while Cunningham talked to girls from the class.</p>
        <p> "It was a bad couple of days," said Delaney, who spent the next few days helping Cunningham through an obvious struggle with alcohol and depression over what he had disclosed.</p>
        <p> Delaney recognized the pain. He had gone public with his abuse in 2005.</p>
        <p> "He was in a dark place," Delaney said. " A place that I knew well."</p>
        <p> ---------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> The final straw for Jim Cunningham came on a weeknight in a rented apartment.</p>
        <p> He and his long-term girlfriend had broken up. He has finished more inpatient alcohol rehabilitation with help from his family. And this time, he told Schaffer, he told treatment center therapists about the abuse. He received a form of eye therapy
          aimed at helping curb the post-traumatic stress of replaying scary memories.</p>
        <p>"Looked good," Schaffer said of the one Sunday he visited Cunningham in treatment, in the presence of Cunningham's brother and a nephew. When he got out, Cunningham was on an anti-alcohol drug, Naltrexone, which makes you sick if you drink while
          taking it.</p>
        <p> But the workload at the jail was high. Cunningham was still designing the new treatment program there.</p>
        <p> "Jim," Schaffer asked one day after his return to the prison, "you still on that Naltrexone?"</p>
        <p> "No," Cunningham said. "I stopped it." He had been going to a lot of support meetings, he reportedly said, and thought that was enough.</p>
        <p> "That's a mistake," Schaffer told him.</p>
        <p> He did not listen. His alcoholism had gotten the better of him, and Schaffer could only watch the disintegration.</p>
        <p> "That's when he really fell apart," Schaffer said. "He fell apart psychologically."</p>
        <p> Both men were fired that winter. Schaffer continued to work on consulting jobs across Pennsylvania. Cunningham's mom found him an apartment in a three-story Victorian in quaint Doylestown. He was dating someone he had met in rehab and struggled
          to find a new job.</p>
        <p> In January, he reached out to Kristen, who long ago had moved away with her family to Exeter Township, more than an hour away.</p>

        <p> "He needed $1,500," Kristen Ott said. "He was talking about having job interviews, but he didn't have gas money. I was sending him Wawa gift cards."</p>
        <p> He found a job, but it paid less than he had been making. He met Schaffer at a diner and told him how things were going.</p>
        <p> "He said that he was totally broke," Schaffer recalled. "He was about to get evicted, he had no cable. They were going to repossess his car because he was back on his car payments. So I gave him a couple of hundred dollars."</p>
        <p> Schaffer again offered money later that month.</p>
        <p> "No, no, no please don't do that," Cunningham said. A week later, Cunningham texted that he had lost the new job.</p>
        <p> At 9:55 p.m. on Thursday, February 9th, Cunningham went to Facebook. This time, the post was set for all the public to see.</p>

        <p> "To all those I've helped, please remember me. To all those who judge and disparage and discount, fuck you."</p>
        <p> Marita McNichol, a former St. Cecilia's youth sports counselor, posted the first worried comment.</p>
        <p> "You ok cuz?" she asked.</p>
        <p> "No," Cunningham told them.</p>
        <p> "What's up, brother ? What's up?" asked Delaney.</p>
        <p> Cunningham's mom contacted police. She was worried he might hurt himself. Police arrived and for an hour he texted officers. At the same time, posts on his Facebook page continued. Eventually, the Central Bucks Special Response Team -- the guys
          he had once helped -- were on the scene, too.</p>
        <p>After an hour, he erased all doubts on Facebook about what was on his mind.</p>
        <p> "This is the face," he wrote, "of being raped as a child."</p>
        <p> Cunningham criticized members of his family, saying they had not believed him.</p>
        <p> "I've been an alcoholic for twenty plus years keeping this bullshit to myself until recently."</p>
        <p> "Jimmy please keep your head up," Emery wrote. "One day at a time" (sic)</p>
        <p> In his final post, Cunningham took one more swipe at those he loved the most.</p>
        <p> Central Bucks Regional Police Chief James Donnelly and others on the scene that night would say nothing about what Cunningham said to them. They refused even to release an incident report to Cunningham's mother. Did he mention a priest? Anything
          else? All Donnelly said in the hours after the incident was that Cunningham had said he had a gun. [CHECK CQ THIS]</p>
        <p>When they eventually got inside, officers found Cunningham hanging inside a closet. No guns anywhere. He died near a rosary on the floor and a cross on the kitchen table.</p>
        <p>The coroner declared it a suicide, listing time of death as 5:51 a.m.</p>
        <p>That morning, word of his death spread like a punch to the stomach.</p>
